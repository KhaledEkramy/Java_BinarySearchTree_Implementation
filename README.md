# Java_BinarySearchTree_Implementation
A Binary Search tree having the following methods : insert() / isEmpty() / find(long key) / delete(long key) / getSuccessor(Node delNode) / findMin(Max)Value() / height()/size()/bool containsNonBST(int item)/toString()/toArrayList()/displayBinaryTree()/displayInOrder(Node localRoot)/displayPreOrder(Node localRoot)/displayPostOrder(Node localRoot)

Introduction
Write java code to create "Student" class that contain name, ID, and numeric grade attributes. You may use the ID or the grade as a key. You may add more attributes when necessary (e,g student object when creating binary trees).  Your program must define a java
application (main method to test your work). Your program must be able to count the number of comparisons and. Swaps in each algorithm. As a testing data you may enter about 20 students' data. The evaluation of the projects will focus on free of errors running programs.
Methods :  Consider a BST (binary search tree) data structure. Write java implementation for the following methods. Use students class as explained above.
A recursive int height() method which returns the height of the tree. If the tree is empty, return -1. The recursion will happen in the
BinaryNode class in this method and others.
A recursive int size() method which returns the number of elements in the tree.
A recursive boolean containsNonBST(item) method that returns true if and only if the item is in the tree.
• A boolean isEmpty() method, which returns true if the tree is empty and false otherwise.
A recursive String toString() method which returns a String
containing the elements of the tree.
An ArrayList<Object> toArrayList() method which returns an ArrayList of the elements in-order.
